A discovery flight is the single best way to find out if you want to become a pilot. It's not a simulation or a ride-along — you'll actually fly the airplane. Here's exactly what to expect from your first 30 minutes in the cockpit.

## Before You Arrive

When you book a discovery flight at John Doe Academy, we'll confirm your appointment and send you a brief overview of what to expect. There's nothing you need to study or prepare in advance.

**What to wear:** Comfortable clothing and closed-toe shoes. Sunglasses are helpful — the Texas sun is bright at altitude. Avoid loose scarves or long necklaces that could interfere with the seatbelt or headset.

**What to bring:** Just yourself and a photo ID. We provide everything else — the aircraft, the instructor, and the headset.

**Arrive 15 minutes early.** This gives you time to check in, meet your instructor, and ask any questions before heading to the aircraft.

## Meeting Your Instructor

Your instructor will greet you in our flight school lobby. They'll introduce themselves, ask about your interest in flying, and explain how the lesson will flow.

This is a low-pressure conversation. Whether you're exploring a career change, pursuing a lifelong dream, or just curious — every reason is a good reason.

Your instructor will also cover a few basic safety items: how the seatbelt works, where the fire extinguisher is, and what to do in the unlikely event of an emergency. This takes about 5 minutes.

## The Pre-Flight Walkthrough

Before every flight, pilots inspect the aircraft. Your instructor will walk you around the plane, explaining each component:

- **The propeller and engine** — checking oil levels and structural integrity
- **The wings** — inspecting ailerons, flaps, and fuel levels
- **The tail** — checking the rudder and elevator
- **The landing gear** — tires, brakes, and struts

This walkthrough isn't just routine — it's one of the most important habits a pilot develops. You'll start learning good airmanship from the very first minute.

## Getting in the Cockpit

You'll sit in the left seat — the pilot's seat. Your instructor will be in the right seat, with full dual controls. They can take over at any time, so there's zero risk.

Once you're buckled in and your headset is on, your instructor will explain the primary flight instruments:

- **Airspeed indicator** — how fast you're going
- **Altimeter** — how high you are
- **Attitude indicator** — your orientation relative to the horizon
- **Heading indicator** — which direction you're flying

You don't need to memorize anything. Your instructor will guide you through each step.

## Startup, Taxi, and Takeoff

Your instructor will start the engine and communicate with ground control (or announce on the common frequency at non-towered fields). You'll taxi to the runway together — your instructor will likely let you steer with your feet on the rudder pedals.

For takeoff, your instructor will manage the throttle while you keep the airplane straight on the runway using the rudder. As you reach flying speed (around 55–60 knots in a Cessna 172), you'll gently pull back on the yoke — and you'll feel the wheels leave the ground.

That moment never gets old, no matter how many times you fly.

## Your Time at the Controls

Once airborne and at a safe altitude (typically 3,000–4,000 feet above Austin), your instructor will hand you the controls. You'll practice:

- **Straight and level flight** — keeping a constant altitude and heading
- **Gentle turns** — banking left and right, following the Colorado River or Lake Travis
- **Climbs and descents** — controlling altitude with the yoke and throttle

The view from above Austin is spectacular. You'll see the downtown skyline, the Hill Country stretching west, and Lake Travis winding through the hills. On clear days, you can see 50+ miles in every direction.

Your instructor will talk you through everything. If at any point you want to let go of the controls, that's completely fine. The airplane won't do anything unexpected — and your instructor is always there.

## Heading Back and Landing

After about 20 minutes in the air, your instructor will take over for the approach and landing. You'll fly back toward the airport, enter the traffic pattern, and descend toward the runway.

You're welcome to keep your hands on the controls during the approach to feel what a landing looks like — the gradual descent, the flare just above the runway, and the smooth (hopefully) touchdown.

## After the Flight

Back on the ground, your instructor will answer any questions and talk through next steps — only if you're interested. There's absolutely no pressure to sign up for anything.

Most people walk away from their discovery flight with one of two reactions:

1. **"That was fun but I'm good."** No problem at all. You've had an incredible experience.
2. **"When can I come back?"** That's when we help you build a training plan.

## What a Discovery Flight Costs

At John Doe Academy, a discovery flight is $199. That covers the aircraft, the instructor, the fuel, and approximately 30 minutes of flight time. It's one of the most affordable ways to experience genuine hands-on flying.

## Book Your Discovery Flight

The hardest part of learning to fly is making the first phone call. Everything after that is momentum.

Book online or give us a call. We'll find a time that works for your schedule, pair you with one of our experienced instructors, and get you in the air. No experience needed. No strings attached.

Just you, the airplane, and the Texas sky.
